I have a degree in secondary education (English/Communications/Journalism/Speech) and a law
degree and have been practicing law for the past sixteen years.  My legal career has been
mostly in the area of employment law, but I've also done some general litigation and commercial
transactions work.  I've worked for in-house legal teams in Fortune 50 companies as well as 
in private practice and for the federal government.  

Based on my background, I think my transferrable skills include:
-extensive understanding how businesses operate
-high understanding of language
-excellent communication skills
-ability to process information and translate it in a way that others can understand
