I started off taking the Intro to Programming Nanodegree and learning Python, and I found
digging into Python with no programming background very challenging.  With some basic 
understanding of programming now, I am hoping that the learning curve will be less steep 
learning Ruby.  
-Are there any outside resources that you recommend for studying along with the course for 
learning Ruby?
-Do you have any recommendations for someone changing careers?
